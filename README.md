# portfolio-revisited
Now that I have incorporated flexbox into my CSS repertoire, it's time to revisit my portfolio. For this project, I'll start from scratch, and build a full page of content that represents my portfolio. I will start by creating a brand new `index.html` file as well as a `styles.css` file.


## Requirements

* At least three commits in git using the command line
* My project should be hosted on GitHub Pages
* Mutiple containers must use flexbox (`display: flex`)
* I must have containers that display their content both horizontally or vertically
* I must incorporate all of the following elements
  * links
  * one or more images
  * use of color
  * multiple sizes of text
